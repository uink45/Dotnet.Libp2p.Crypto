# Dotnet.Libp2p.Crypto


A C# implementation of crypto primitives needed for Libp2p. This is the same repository as [LibP2P.Crypto](https://github.com/tabrath/cs-libp2p/tree/master/LibP2P.Crypto), with the following changes made:

- added support for Secp256k1.
- removed reliance on the [libsodium](https://github.com/adamcaudill/libsodium-net) library.

## TODO
Write test cases to ensure the functionalities of crypto primitives.
